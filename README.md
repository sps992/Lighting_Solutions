# Lighting Solutions

## A Work in Progress

This project was never completely finished and then shelved due to the client changing his mind and project scope. It was a big learning curve, not just with the coding itself but also with the way I need to avoid this happeningin the future.

## Looking Back

When I look back at this project I realise how valuable wireframing and using a project proposal really is, and stands to be one of the main reasons I use it today in my current work.
